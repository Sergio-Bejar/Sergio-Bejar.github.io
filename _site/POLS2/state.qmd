# Objectives

- Define "state."
- Compare state vs. government and state vs. nation.
- Understand different explanations of state formation (i.e. How and why states are formed).
- Compare different explanations of state formation.
- Analyze consequences of state fragility. 

# Definition

## From the textbook:

The state is a political-legal unit with sovereignty over a particular territory and the population that resides within its borders. 

# Another definition

## Charles Tilly: 

Relative centralized, differentiated organizations the officials of which more or less successfully claim control over chief centralized means of violence within a population inhabiting a large, contiguous territory. 

# Definitions of Nation and Government 

## Nation
Nation: a grouping of individuals who associate based on collectively held political identity.

## Government 
The organization that has the authority to act on behalf of the state and the right to make decisions that affect everyone in the state.



# Success of the State Depends on:

- **Legitimacy:** We accept that the state has the sovereign authority to use force.

- **Sovereignty:** Ultimate responsibility for and legal authority over the conduct of internal affairs.

- **Efficiency:** Ability of states to maintain effective order. 

# Individual and Collective Choices Sometimes Clash

Successful states efficiently solve a **Collective Action** problem.

# What heppens when problems of collective action are not solved?

The state of nature is **ANARCHY.**

# Theories of State Formation 1: Social Contract

- Proposed by Thomas Hobbes. 

- Everyone limits their ability to do as they please in order to achieve some collective benefit.

- The state and its institutions: guarantors of the social contract. 

# Theories of State Formation 2: Predatory States

- Proposed by Charles Tilly.

- Rulers fight wars with external rivals. So, they need resources to do it. 

- To get resources they do 2 things: (i) eliminate internal rivals, and (ii) create institutions that help them to administer and use those resources. Together, they result in "state-making" capacity.  

# Functions of the State (Tilly)

- **War making:** Eliminating or neutralizing their own rivals outside the territories in which they have clear and continuous priority as wielders of force. 

- **State making:** Eliminating or neutralizing their rivals inside those territories. 

- **Protection:** Eliminating or neutralizing the enemies of their clients 

- **Extraction:** Acquiring the means of carrying out the first three activities.

**"War made the state, and the state made war"** (Tilly)

# Early State Formation

## Military Context 
- A vicious cycle: increase in warfare led to increase in military expenditures and  to an  increase in taxation extraction needs, best achieved from a larger territory.

## Economic Context
- Increase in agricultural productivity.
- The growth of industry, trade and commerce, as well as cities.
- The exploitation of overseas territories and empires.

## Political Context 
- Individual self interest replaces notions of predestination.
- Protestant Reformation.
- The Age of Enlightenment. 

# Late State Formation 1

## Military Context 
- Post 1945: few interstate wars.
- High incidence of civil wars.
- Lack of military pressure = lack of incentive for the creation of a strong state.

## Economic Context 
- The legacy of European colonialism.
- Lack of experience with independent economic development.

## Political Context
- Borders established arbitrarily.
- Weak national identity.
- Weak  connection between state and nation. 

# Late State Formation 2 

## The Natural Environment 
- Difficult territories make the reach of the state more expensive and less efficient.

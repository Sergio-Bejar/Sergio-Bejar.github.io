Originally from MÃ©xico, a first generation college student, I obtained my Ph.D. from the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.nd.edu) at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu) in 2011. Outside academia, running is my biggest passion.  I have competed in some of the most iconic marathons in the world including the [BMW Berlin Marathon](https://www.bmw-berlin-marathon.com/en/), the [TCS New York City Marathon](https://www.nyrr.org/tcsnycmarathon), the [Bank of America Chicago Marathon](https://www.chicagomarathon.com), and the [Boston Marathon](https://www.baa.org). 30+ full marathons later, I am still running strong.

Originally from MÃ©xico, a first generation college student, I obtained my Ph.D. from the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.nd.edu) at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu) in 2011. I did my BA in Economics at [Tec de Monterrey](https://tec.mx/en) in Mexico, and a MA in Economics at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.econ.pitt.edu/) where I became a [Steelers](https://www.steelers.com/) fan. 

Outside academia, I have two big passions: running and traveling. As a long-distance-runner, I have competed in some of the most iconic marathons in the world including the [BMW Berlin Marathon](https://www.bmw-berlin-marathon.com/en/), the [TCS New York City Marathon](https://www.nyrr.org/tcsnycmarathon), the [Bank of America Chicago Marathon](https://www.chicagomarathon.com), and the [Boston Marathon](https://www.baa.org). While I do not have much time to travel for fun during the fall and spring semester, I try to get away as much as possible during the winter and summer breaks. I have visited 27 countries and counting.
